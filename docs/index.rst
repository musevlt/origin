History
-------

This software was initially developed by Carole Clastres, under the supervision
of David Mary (Lagrange institute, University of Nice) and Roland Bacon (CRAL).
It was then ported to Python by Laure Piqueras (CRAL). From November 2016 to
November 2017 the software was developed by Antony Schutz (CRAL/Lagrange) and
Laure. Then it was developed by Simon Conseil (CRAL), in parallel with an Octave
version by David, and with contributions from Yannick Roehlly (CRAL). A lot of
testing has been done also by Roland Bacon (CRAL), which also produced simulated
cubes.

The project was funded by the ERC MUSICOS (Roland Bacon, CRAL).
