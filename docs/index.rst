        This documentation is for the version of ORIGIN currently under
        development.

.. include:: ../README.rst

This software was initially developed by Carole Clastres, under the supervision
of David Mary (Lagrange institute, University of Nice). It was then ported to
Python by Laure Piqueras (CRAL). From November 2016 to November 2107 the
software was developed by Antony Schutz (CRAL/Lagrange) and Laure. Then it was
developed by Simon Conseil (CRAL), in parallel with an Octave version by David,
and with contributions from Yannick Roehlly (CRAL). A lot of testing has been
done also by Roland Bacon (CRAL), which also produced simulated cubes.

The project is funded by the ERC MUSICOS (Roland Bacon, CRAL).
