ORIGIN is a Python software for the blind detection of faint emission line
galaxies in MUSE datacubes.

This software has been developped by Carole Clastres and Antony Schutz
under the supervision of David Mary (Lagrange institute, University of Nice)
and ported to Python and developed by Laure Piqueras and Simon Conseil (CRAL).

The project is funded by the ERC MUSICOS (Roland Bacon, CRAL). Please contact
David for more info at XXXX (TODO).

A paper describing the original method is in preparation and will be available
here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/XXXXXXXXX (TODO)
